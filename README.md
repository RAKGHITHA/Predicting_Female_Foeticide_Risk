# Predicting_Female_Foeticide_Risk

Female Foeticide Risk Analysis and Prediction

# Project Overview
This project analyzes and predicts female foeticide risk levels based on social and demographic indicators such as literacy rate, employment rate, and access to healthcare.
It uses a Random Forest Classifier to predict the risk level for each district and evaluates the model's performance using accuracy and F1 score.

## Dataset
The dataset contains features like literacy rate, poverty index, income, health access, etc.

## Steps
1. Data cleaning & handling missing values  
2. Feature engineering (literacy gap)  
3. LabelEncoding categorical features  
4. Train Random Forest Classifier  
5. Evaluate model (Accuracy, F1 score)  
6. Analyze feature importance  

## Libraries Used
- pandas  
- numpy  
- scikit-learn  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn
